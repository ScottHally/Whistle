# Whistle
Simple recreation of a prize-based arcade game.

If you have been directed here by me to just play the game:
  - Download the project (click the "code" button with the down arrow), make sure the branch (option to the left)
      says "main". Select "Download ZIP".
  - Extract the folder to a directory of your choosing.
  - In the main folder (Whistle), open the game.html file (only tested in Firefox currently)
    - Make sure to open it in a browser. Depending on your OS double clicking the file may bring up
      a text editor by default. If this is the case, try right clicking the file and selecting your
      browser under "Open With"
  - Make sure volume is lowered or muted (I've adjusted the sound effects to be quieter but they still may be loud depending how high your volume is)
  - Hit PLAY WHISTLE STOP
 
 
 Notes: 
  - Ignore the TEST button, it was to test win conditions, but has not been updated 
  since early on, and will most likely cause the game to stop functioning correctly.
