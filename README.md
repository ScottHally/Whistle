# Whistle
Simple recreation of a prize-based arcade game.

If you have been directed here by me to just play the game:
  - Download the project (click the "code" button with the down arrow), make sure the branch (option to the left)
      says "main". Select "Download ZIP".
  - Extract the folder to a directory of your choosing.
  - In the main folder (Whistle), open the game.html file (only tested in Firefox currently)
  - Lower your volume (especially if using headphones)
    Currently there is only one sound effect, which is a mostly unedited file of a guitar riff with high gain.
    As such, the sound may be loud depending on your volume setting. Alternative is to click the mute icon in
    the top left before clicking play.
  - Hit PLAY WHISTLE STOP
 
 
 Notes: 
  - Ignore the TEST button, it was to test win conditions, but has not been updated 
  since early on, and will most likely cause the game to stop functioning correctly.
